{"name":"jquery-filters","tagline":"jquery search result filter examples","body":"# jquery-filters\r\njquery-filters repository contains several examples on how to filter search results with jQuery.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis repository contains several examples of how to filter search results with jQuery. \r\n\r\nThere are several ways to approach this, however this example is focused on the use of jQuery selectors (<a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) and the use of <code>.hide()</code> and <code>.css()</code>.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the use of regular expressions is fundamental to any form of filtering returned or sent data. Click <a href=\"http://www.regexr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for a useful regex online tool to experiment and test your expressions.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nIf you need an apache server, I use Apache Tomcat for Java development. The download links are below:\r\n\r\nDownload Apache Tomcat here: http://tomcat.apache.org/index.html\r\n\r\nDownload jquery here: https://jquery.com/download/\r\n\r\njQuery-UI is not necessary for this example but its useful if you'd like to use it for your project.\r\n\r\nDownload jquery-ui here: http://jqueryui.com/download/\r\n\r\nJSON is not necessary either but here is the download link if you would like to learn more on how to implement both jQuery and JSON. Below is the JAR file for Apache Tomcat, but there are other alternatives such as json-simple.\r\n\r\nDownload JSON JAR here: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjavajsonjar.htm (Apache Tomcat Only)\r\n\r\n### API Reference\r\n\r\njQuery have a ton of functionalities and it is important to keep an update on its features and bugs. Also, keep in mind of cross-browser issues as you may encounter them in the future. Below is the link for the jQuery API documentation:\r\n\r\njQuery API Documentation: https://api.jquery.com/\r\n\r\njQuery UI is an extension of jQuery and it is a valuable asset. It is catered to full functionality customization and with great integration with other plugins. For example, the most popular usage is the datepicker function, which you may have seen it implemented in most web applications from both private and government sectors.\r\n\r\njQuery UI API Documentation: https://api.jqueryui.com/\r\n\r\n### Testing and Understanding\r\n\r\nThe sample results are categorized based on these attributes, for example <code>data-id=\"A123\" data-category=\"fruit apple\"</code>. \r\n\r\nYou'll notice that the attribute <code>data-category</code> have two values (seperated by space). It is formatted to place each result with specific categories, for example:\r\n\r\nParent Category: <b>fruit</b><br>\r\nChild Category: <b>apple</b>\r\n\r\nHowever, <code>data-id</code> does not contribute much at the moment but later in implementation, you may come across certain scenarios that you may need this type of attribute, whether it is the ISBN number of a book or employee ID number to match the employee's gathered information.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
